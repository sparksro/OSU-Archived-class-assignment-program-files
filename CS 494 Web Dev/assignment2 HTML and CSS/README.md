This assignment is complete. I hit every thing on the list and then some. 

Code sources: Some of my code in this weeks assignment was patterned after code here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started Especially the html and css code for the table. Other code was patterned from lectures, namely the forms code. All of the patterened example code was highly adapted and changed to make it what I needed.
