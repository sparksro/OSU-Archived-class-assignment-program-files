Assignment6
Rob Sparks

This weeks assignment I acomplished almost entirely with php pages and a bit 
of HTML.  I did originally do a more complext version of the price change by 
percent.  I added a check box for increase or decrease then the percent increase
was additive and decrease subracted from the price.  I had error messages to 
warn if both boxes were checked or not checked etc.  I was changed to reflect 
the testing procudures added later to the assignment document.
