My project was the creation of a sci-fi fan data base and its here.

Added note: This is the to conclude the final commit.  I had some extr time so I did some validator error correction. Each page has about 3-5 remaining html validator flaged errors that don't appear to be errors and dont seem to true. I don't understand why they are getting flaged as they dont appear to be genuine.

I was able to complete all the requirements of the project directions and some extras.  It features a required user log in process.  If your not a registered user you are presented with a registration form to register.  It is also necessary that your account be activated to access and and activation link will be sent to your email address via the email address you place in the registration from.  A real email address is required.  It uses two different data bases.  One to keeps track of user names and the second a double hashed and salted with a random number based on the users password.  The second data base stores user entries.  

The user can enter a sci-fi medium, movie book or etc., a title, description and a screen capture or picture.  The user entry starts with a single automatic vote and then all the users can vote them up or down.  My Brother died this past week and we had the necessary family time / memorial service so I ran out of time to chase down bugs.  The vote system still has a bug and does not work correctly.  

The web sites main page is member.php.  It serves three functions and changes via Ajax depending on the situation.  When the user accesses it and there is not an active session then it only displays two links.  One to login and the other to register.  The second function is to display the user data base entries and pictures.  It will only display that particular users entires and users that have decided to share theres.  The third function is to take user entries.  When the user clicks the add and entry button  the lower part of the page is replaced with an entry form. When the user clicks the enter button the entry is stored assuming is passes validation and the page goes back to the display portion of the page.

The following web sites were helpful in building this web site.

This one was an older one done using mysql and I converted the example to mysqli
