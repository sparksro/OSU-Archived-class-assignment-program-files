<<<<<<< HEAD
 As well as playing arround with the online version of github I have also loaded a local version on my laptop.  I 
 sucessfully cloned my stuff there just for practice and was able to then push changes back to the origin 
 which was at the time a test.txt file and then later with Homework1 clone v.1.
 <combined here>
In this bio I am not going to realy talk about me so much as the the last homwork 1 clone v.1.  In that version I had 
some initial trouble with the branch merge.  I think it was because I copy and pasted from my text edditor and because 
I had comflicting text on the same linew.  This time I have left lines 1-3 blank in reserve for the master branch.  Also I
am making sure the text is on multiple lines instead of a a bunch of wraped text on one or two lines.  
Notes: 

-As of this update still having problmes with merge wanting to delete text.  The extra blank lines did not work nieher 
did eliminating them. This is a tryal to see if an updatea and commit to the branch version after the master will do any 
thing.  So far a google search is not turning up a solution.  
-It seems from reading on line sorces is the reason for the merge conflicts is so you can manually edit the mergeing files
I thought of this early on but thought there would be an auto solution.  I thought by seperating by lines that it would
be smart enought to figure it out but maybe  not.  On the next merge I will have manually combined the files.

-As I learn new things the notes are going here into the branch version.  Reading on Stack overflow the merge conflict is 
caused by editing the same file in to different places and does require a manual merge.  Encountered another problem
with with a local clone to my HD it picked up the master branch but not the programing-bio branch.  Currently researching
this.  local: git branch -a will show all the branches http://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-with-git
    git checkout -b programing-bio  switched so I could see it but it put it changed Head location locally to progrmming-bio
    I then did a git fetch this put the programming-bio files on my HD but repleaced the master branch ones.  This is
    some what out of the scope of this assignment and I will probably continue to solve this at a later time.
    I can fix this with manual edit/ cut and paist for now.
